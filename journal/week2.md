# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Introduction:
This document outlines the tasks for Week 2 of the AWS Bootcamp 2023, which aims to set up monitoring tools for the application. I encountered an issue with environment settings, which was not always correct. However, it was great to learn how to troubleshoot the issue with Docker extensions and view logs from there.
